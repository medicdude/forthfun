funforth Relocator Branch

Project Purpose
To create a relocator program/instruction set that successfully copies/moves already compiled code from RAM to disk
To create a loader program that copies data from disk into another computer's RAM, regardless of address position installed

Major problem: pointers that pointed within code block will no longer point to the correct location
Solution: the distance-difference in address space will be the same for every pointer. 
Save program must find pointer locations and append to the end of the save file. Must also save original memory location.
Load program will calculate distance-difference from old memory location to new memory location, and update all pointers with this difference.
